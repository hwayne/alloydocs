About Alloy
--------------

Alloy is a tool for analyzing systems and seeing if they are designed correctly. You can read more `here <http://www.alloytools.org/>`__ and download it `here <http://alloytools.org/download.html>`__.


About This Guide
-------------------

This is my tentative proposed documentation for the Alloy language. 

**This is not the official Alloy documentation.** It's a staging ground for material that's intended to *become* official documentation, but for now I'm writing this independently, not as part of the alloy board.

**This is a work in progress.** This documentation is incomplete and changes may be made. There are also a lot of things that still need to be added.

**This is meant as a reference**, not a tutorial. 

**This is not comprehensive**. Certain things are intentionally excluded, like bitshift operators, specific internal modules, anonymous predicates, and Alloy 3 legacy syntax. Generally these are things that I personally believe are only useful in very specific niche cases, and otherwise serve to confuse things.

How to Read
-----------

I’ve added commentary in the markup of the pages that is invisible in
the final output. If you see something

::

  .. like this

Then it will not be rendered. If I used a special ``run`` predicate to
generate a particular visualization, I put it in a comment.

Anything with a ``[⋇]`` is an advanced topic and unecessary to learn if you're just a beginner.
