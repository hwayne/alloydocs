Expressions and Constraints

.. _expressions:

Expressions
===========

Expressions are anything that returns a number, boolean, or set. Boolean
expressions are also called `constraints`.

Information about relational expressions are found in the `sets` and `relations` chapters. There are two additional constructs that can be used with both boolean and relational
expressions.

.. seealso::

  `Integer <integers>` expressions

.. _let:

Let
--------

``let`` defines a local value for the purposes of the subexpression.

.. code:: alloy

   let x = A + B, y = C + D |
      x + y

In the context of the ``let`` expression ``x + y = (A + B) + (C + D)``.
``let`` is mostly used to simplify complex expressions and give
meaningful names to intermediate computations.

If writing a boolean expression, you may use a ``{}`` instead of ``|``.

``let`` bindings are not recursive. A ``let`` binding may not refer to
itself or a future ``let`` binding.

.. warning:: 

  As with :ref:`predicate <predicates>` parameters, ``let`` can `shadow <@>` a global value. You can use the ``@`` operator to retrieve the global value.

.. _implies:

implies - else
--------------

When used in conjunction with ``else``, ``implies`` acts as a
conditional. ``p implies A else B`` returns A if p is true and B if p is
false. ``p`` must be a boolean expression.

If A and B are boolean expressions, then this acts as a constraint. The ``else`` can be left out if using ``implies`` as a constraint. See `below <implies constraint>` for details.

.. _constraints:

Constraints
===========

.. _bar:

Bar expressions
---------------

A bar expression is one of the form:

::

     some x: Set | 
       expr

In this context, the expression is true iff ``expr`` is true. The newline is optional.

Paragraph expressions
---------------------

If multiple constraints are surrounded with braces, they are all
``and``-ed together. The following two are equivalent:

.. code:: alloy

     expr1 or {
       expr2
       expr3
         ...
     }

     expr1 or (expr 2 and expr3 and ...)

.. _constraint-types:

Constraint Types
----------------

All constraints can be inverted with ``not`` or ``!``. To say that A is
not a subset of B, you can write ``A !in B``, ``A not in B``,
``!(A in B)``, etc.

Relation Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _=:

``=``
^^^^^

``A = B`` means that both sets of atoms or relations have the exact same
elements. ``=`` *cannot* be used to compare two booleans. Use ``iff``
instead.

.. _in:

``in``
^^^^^^

-  ``A in B`` means that every element of A is also an element of B.
   This is also known as a “subset” relation.
-  ``x in A`` means that x is an element of the set A.

.. note:: The above two definitions are equivalent as all atoms are singleton sets: x is the set containing x, so ``x in A`` is “the set containing just x is a subset of A”.

.. _size-constraints:

size constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are four constraints on the number of elements in a set:


-  ``no A`` means A is empty.
-  ``some A`` means A has *at least one* element.
-  ``one A`` means A has *exactly one* element.
-  ``lone A`` means A is either empty or has exactly one element.

In practice, ``no`` and ``some`` are considerably more useful than
``one`` and ``lone``.

.. note:: Relations are each exactly one element, no matter the order of the relation. If ``a``, ``b,`` and ``c`` are individual atoms, ``(a -> b -> c)`` is exactly one element, while ``(a -> b) + (a -> c)`` is two.

.. _disj constraint:

``disj[A, B]``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``disj[A, B]`` is the predicate “A and B share no elements in common”.
Any number of arguments can be used, in which case ``disj`` is
*pairwise-disjoint*. This means that ``disj[A, B, C]`` is equivalent to
``disj[A, B] and disj[B, C] and disj[A, C]``.

Boolean Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Boolean constraints operate on booleans or predicates. They can be used
to create more complex constraints.

All boolean constraints have two different forms, a symbolic form and an
English form. For example, ``A && B`` can also be written ``A and B``.

=========== =======
word        symbol
=========== =======
``and``     ``&&``
``or``      ``||``
``not``     ``!``
``implies`` ``=>``
``iff``     ``<=>``
=========== =======

The first three are self-explanatory. The other two are covered below:

.. TODO:: Link to the spec for precedence, really not worth copying over

.. _implies constraint:

``implies`` (``=>``)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``P implies Q`` is true if Q is true whenever P is true. If P is true
and Q is false, then ``P implies Q`` is false. If P is false, then
``P implies Q`` is automatically true. ``P implies Q else T`` is true if P and Q are true or if P is false and T is true.

(Consider the statement ``x > 5 implies x > 3``. If we pick ``x = 4``,
then we have ``false implies true``).

``iff`` (``<=>``)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``P iff Q`` is true if P and Q are both true or both false. Use this for
booleans instead of ``=``.

.. TIP:: ``xor[A, B]`` can be written as ``A <=> !B``.

.. _quantifiers:

Quantifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~

A **quantifier** is an expression about the elements of a set. All of
them have the form

::

     some x: A | 
       expr

This expression is true if ``expr`` is true for any element of the set
of atoms ``A``. As with ``let``, ``x`` becomes a valid identifier in the
body of the constraint.

Instead of using a pipe, you can also write it as

::

     some x: Set { 
       expr1
       ...
     }

In which case it is treated as a standard paragraph expression.

The following quantifiers are available:

-  ``some x: A | expr`` is true for *at least one* element in ``A``.
-  ``all x: A | expr`` is true for *every* element in ``A``.
-  ``no x: A | expr`` is **false** for every element of ``A``.
-  [A] ``one x: A | expr`` is true for exactly one element of ``A``.
-  [A] ``lone x: A`` is equivalent to
   ``(one x: A | expr) or (no x: A | expr)``.

As `discussed below <multiple-quantifiers>`, ``one`` and ``lone`` can have some unintuitive
consequences.

.. TIP:: As with all constraints, ``A`` can be any set expression. So you can write ``some x: (A + B - C).rel``, etc.

.. _multiple-quantifiers:

Multiple Quantifiers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two syntaxes to quantify over multiple elements:

.. code:: alloy

   -- 1
   some x, y, ...: A | expr

   -- 2
   some x: A, y: B, ... | expr

For case (1) all elements will be drawn from ``A``. For case (2) the
quantifier will be over all possible combinations of elements from A and
B. The two forms can be combined, as in
``all x, y: A, z: B, ... | expr``.

Elements drawn do **not** need to be distinct. This means, for example,
that the following is automatically false if A has any elements:

.. code:: alloy

   all x, y: A |
     x.rel != y.rel

.. todo:: call out distinct elements

As we can pick the same element for ``x`` and ``y``. If this is not your
intention, there are two ways to fix this:

.. code:: alloy

   -- 1
   all x, y: A |
     x != y => x.rel != y.rel

   -- 2
   all disj x, y: A |
     x.rel != y.rel

For case (1) we can still select the same element for ``x`` and ``y``;
however, the ``x != y`` clause will be false, making the whole clause
true. For case (2), using ``disj`` in a quantifier means we cannot
select the same element for two variables.

``one`` and ``lone`` behave unintuitively when used in
multiple quantifiers. The following two statements are different:

.. code:: alloy

   one f, g: S | P[f, g] -- 1
   one f: S | one g: S | P[f, g] -- 2

Constraint (1) is only true if there is *exactly one* pair f, g that
satisfies predicate P. Constraint (2) says that there’s exactly one f
such that there’s exactly one g. The following truth table will satisfy
clause (2) *but not* (1):

= = =======
f g P[f, g]
= = =======
A B T
A C T
B A T
B C T
C B T
C A F
= = =======

As C is the only one where there is *exactly one* g that satisfies P[C,
g]. As a rule of thumb, use only ``some`` and ``all`` when writing
multiple clauses.

.. rst-class:: advanced

Relational Quantifiers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using a `run` command, you can define a ``some`` quantifier over a relation:

.. code:: alloy

   sig Node {
       edge: set Node
   }

   pred has_self_loop {
       some e: edge | e = ~e
       
   }

   run {
       has_self_loop
   }

When using a `check` command, you can define ``all`` and ``no`` quantifiers over relations:

.. code:: alloy
   
  assert no_self_loops {
	  no e: edge | e = ~e
	}
    
  check no_self_loops

You **cannot** use ``all`` or ``no`` in a run command or use ``some`` in a check command. You **cannot** use higher-order quantifiers in the `evaluator` regardless of the command.
