Sets and Relations

.. _sets:

Sets
====

A set is a collection of unique, unordered elements. All Alloy
expressions use sets of atoms and :ref:`relations`. All
elements of a set must have the same arity, but can otherwise freely mix
types of elements.

Adding a signature automatically defines the set of all atoms in that
signature. Given

.. code:: alloy

   sig Teacher {}
   sig Student {
     teacher: Teacher
   }

Then the spec recognizes ``Student`` as the set of all atoms of type
``Student``, and likewise with the ``Teacher`` signature and the
``teacher`` relationship.

Everything in Alloy is a set. If ``S1`` is a ``Student`` atom, then
``S1`` is the set containing just ``S1`` as an element.

There are also two special sets:

.. _none:

.. _univ:

-  ``none`` is just the empty set. Saying ``no Set`` is the same as saying ``Set = none``. See :ref:`expressions`.
-  ``univ`` is the set of all atoms in the model. In this example, ``univ = Student + Teacher``.

.. note::

  By default, the analyzer also generates a set of integers for each model, which will appear in ``univ``. This can almost always be ignored in specifications (but see :ref:`#` below).

Set Operators
-------------

Set operators can be used to construct new sets from existing ones, for
use in expressions and predicates.

-  ``S1 + S2`` is the set of all elements in either ``S1`` or ``S2``
   (set union).
-  ``S1 - S2`` is the set of all elements in ``S1`` but not ``S2`` (set
   difference).
-  ``S1 & S2`` is the set of all elements in both ``S1`` and ``S2`` (set
   intersection).

.. code:: alloy

   S1 = {A, B}
   S2 = {B, C}

   S1 + S2 = {A, B, C}
   S1 - S2 = {A}
   S1 & S2 = {B}

.. _cartesian-product:

``->`` used as an operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given two sets, ``Set1 -> Set2`` is the *Cartesian product* of the two:
the set of all relations that map any element of ``Set1`` to any element
of ``Set2``.

::

   Set1 = {A, B}
   Set2 = {X, Y, Z}

   Set1 -> Set2 = { 
     A -> X, A -> Y, A -> Z,
     B -> X, B -> Y, B -> Z
   }

As with other operators, a standalone atom is the set
containing that atom. So we can write ``A -> (X + Y)`` to get
``(A -> X + A -> Y)``.

.. todo:: 
  1. it's impossible to construct relations between sets, they're always flattened

  2. this is the only way to construct relations outside of signatures

.. TIP:: ``univ -> univ`` is the set of all possible relations in your model.

.. _integers:

Integers
------------

Alloy has limited support for integers. To enforce bounded models, the
numerical range is finite. By default, Alloy uses models with 4-bit
signed integers: all integers between ``-8`` and ``7``. If an arithmetic
operation would cause this to overflow, then the predicate is
automatically declared false. In the :ref:`evaluator`, however, it will wrap the overflowed number.

.. tip::

  The numerical range can be changed by placing a :ref:`scope <scopes>` on ``Int``. The number of the scope is the number of bits in the signed integers. For example, if the scope is ``5 Int``, the model will have all integers between ``-16`` and ``15``.  

All arithmetic operators are over the given model’s numeric range. To
avoid conflict with set and relation operators, the arithmetic operators
are written as :ref:`functions`:

.. code:: alloy

   add[1, 2]
   sub[1, 2]
   mul[1, 2]
   div[3, 2] -- integer divison, drop remainder
   rem[1, 2] -- remainder

You can use receiver syntax for this, and write ``add[1, 2]`` as
``1.add[2]``. There are also the following comparison predicates:

.. code:: alloy

   1 =< 2
   1 < 2
   1 > 2
   1 >= 2
   1 != 2
   1 = 2

As there are no corresponding symbols for elements to overload, these
operators are written as infixes.

.. warning::
	Sets of integers have non-intuitive properties and should be used with care.

.. _#:

``#``
~~~~~

``#S`` is the number of elements in ``S``.


.. rst-class:: advanced

Sets of numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _sum:

For set operations, a set of numbers are treated as a set. For
arithmetic operations, however, a set of numbers is first summed before
applying the operator. This is equivalent to using the ``sum[]``
function.

::

   (1 + 2) >= 3 -- true
   (1 + 2) <= 3 -- true 
   (1 + 2) = 3  -- false
   (1 + 2).plus[0] = 3 -- true
   (1 + 1).plus[0] = 2 -- false


.. _relations:

Relations
=========

Given the following spec

::

   sig Group {}
   sig User {
     belongs_to: set Group
   }

``belongs_to`` describes a **relation** between ``User`` and ``Group``.
Each individual relation consists of a pair of atoms, the first being
``User``, the second being ``Group``. We write an individual relation
with ``->``. One possible model might have

::

   belongs_to = {
     U1 -> G1 + 
     U2 -> G1 +
     U2 -> G2 
   }

Relations do *not* need to be 1-1: here two users map to ``G1`` and one
user maps to both ``G1`` and ``G2``.


..

  ::

     abstract sig Group {}
     abstract sig User {
        belongs_to: set Group
     }

     one sig U1, U2 extends User {}
     one sig G1, G2 extends Group {}

     fact {
       belongs_to = {
       U1 -> G1 + 
       U2 -> G1 +
       U2 -> G2 
     }
     }

.. image:: img/belongs_to.png

Relations in Alloy are first class objects, and can be manipulated and
used in expressions. [This assumes you already know the set operations].
For example, we can reverse a relation by adding ``~`` before it:

::

   ~belongs_to = {
     G1 -> U1 + 
     G1 -> U2 +
     G2 -> U2 
   }

.. _.:

The . Operator
--------------

The dot (``.``) operator is the most common relationship operator, and has
several different uses. The dot operator is left-binding: ``a.b.c`` is
parsed as ``(a.b).c``, not ``a.(b.c)``.

``Set.rel``
~~~~~~~~~~~

Return every element that elements in ``Set`` map to, via ``rel``. This also works for individual atoms.

::

   U1.belongs_to = G1
   (U1 + U2).belongs_to = {G1, G2}


.. Tip:: In this case, we can find all groups in the relation with ``User.belongs_to``. However, some relations may mix different types of atoms. In that case ``univ.~rel`` is the domain of ``rel`` and ``univ.rel`` is the range of ``rel``.

For `multirelations`, this will return the "tail" of the relation. Eg if ``rel = A -> B -> C``, then ``A.rel = B -> C``.

``rel.Set``
~~~~~~~~~~~

Writing ``rel.Set`` is equivalent to writing ``Set.~rel``. See `~`.

::

   belongs_to.G1 = {U1, U2}
   G1.~belongs_to = {U1, U2}

``rel1.rel2``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can use the dot operator with two relations. It returns the inner
product of the two relations. For example,
given

.. code:: alloy

   rel1 = {A -> B,         B -> A}
   rel2 = {B -> C, 
           B -> D,         A -> E}

   rel1.rel2 = {
           A -> C, 
           A -> D,         B -> E}

In our case with Users and Groups, ``belongs_to.~belongs_to`` maps every
User to every other user that shares a group.

.. _[]:

[]
~~~~~~

``rel[elem]`` is equivalent to writing ``elem.(rel)``. It has a lower
precedence than the ``.`` operator, which makes it useful for
`multirelations`. If we have

::


   sig Light {
      state: Color -> Time
   }

Then ``L.state[C]`` would be all of the times ``T`` where the light ``L`` was color ``C``. The equivalent without ``[]`` would be ``C.(L.state)``.


.. _iden:

iden
----

``iden`` is the relationship mapping every element to itself. If we have
an element ``a`` in our model, then ``(a -> a) in iden``.

An example of iden’s usefulness: if we want to say that ``rel`` doesn’t
have any cycles, we can say ``no iden & ^rel``.

Additional Operators
--------------------

.. NOTE::  You cannot use ``~``, ``^``, or ``*`` with `higher-arity relations <multirelations>`.


.. _~:

``~rel``
~~~~~~~~

As mentioned, ``~rel`` is the reverse of ``rel``.


.. _transitive-closure:

``^`` and ``*``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are the **transitive closure** relationships. Take the following
example:

.. code:: alloy

   sig Node {
     edge: set Node
   }

``N.edge`` is the set of all nodes that ``N`` connects to.
``N.edge.edge`` is the set of all nodes that an edge of ``N`` connects
to. ``N.edge.edge.edge`` is the set of all nodes that are an edge of an
edge of N, ad infinitum. If we want every node that is connected to ``N``,
this is called the transitive closure and is written as ``N.^edge``.

``^`` does *not* include the original atom unless it’s transitively
reachable! In the above example, ``N in N.^edge`` iff the graph has a
cycle containing ``N``. If we want to also include ``N``, use
``N.*edge`` instead.

``^`` operates on the relationship, so ``^edge`` is also itself a
relationship and can be manipulated like any other. We can write both
``~^edge`` and ``^~edge``. It also works on arbitrary relationships.
``U1.^(belongs_to.~belongs_to)`` is the set of people that share a group
with ``U1``, or share a group with people who share a group with ``U1``,
ad infinitum.

.. warning::
  By itself ``*edge`` will include ``iden``! ``*edge = ^edge + iden``. For best results only use ``*`` immediately before joining the closure with another set.

.. rst-class:: advanced

Advanced Operators
----------------------

.. _relation_restriction:

``<:`` and ``:>``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``<:`` is *domain restriction*. ``Set <: rel`` is all of the elements in
``rel`` that **start** with an element in ``Set``. ``:>`` is the *range
restriction*, and works similarly: ``rel :> Set`` is all the elements of
``rel`` that **end** with an element in Set.

This is mostly useful for directly manipulating relations. For example,
given a set S, we can map every element to itself by doing
``S <: iden``.

.. _++:

``++``
~~~~~~

``rel1 ++ rel2`` is the union of the two relations, with one exception: if any relations in ``rel1`` that share a "key" with a relation in ``rel2`` are dropped.  Think of it like merging two dictionaries.

Formally speaking, we have

.. code:: alloy

   rel1 ++ rel2 = rel1 - (rel2.univ <: rel1) + rel2

Some examples of ``++``:

.. code:: alloy

   (A -> B + A -> C) ++ (A -> A) = (A -> A)
   (A -> B + A -> C) ++ (A -> A + A -> C) = (A -> A + A -> C)
   (A -> B + A -> C) ++ (C -> A) = (A -> B + A -> C + C -> A)
   (A -> B + B -> C) ++ (A -> A) = (A -> A + B -> C)

It’s mostly useful for modeling `Time <dynamics>`.

.. Note:: When using multirelations the two relations need the same arity, and it overrides based on only the first element in the relations.

.. rst-class:: advanced
.. _set-comprehensions:

Set Comprehensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set comprehensions are written as

.. code:: alloy

   {x: Set1 | expr[x]}

The expression evaluates to the set of all elements of ``Set1`` where ``expr[x]`` is true. ``expr`` can be any expression and may be inline. Set comprehensions can be used anywhere a set or set expression is valid.

Set comprehensions can use multiple inputs.

.. code:: alloy

   {x: Set1, y: Set2, ... | expr[x,y]}

In this case this comprehension will return relations in ``Set1 -> Set2``.
